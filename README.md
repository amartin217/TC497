‚ùì What it does: Allows two teams of players (human or computer) to play a full game of Euchre.

üë©‚Äçüíª Who it‚Äôs for: Students learning C++ fundamentals such as object-oriented design, polymorphism, operator overloading, and unit testing.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why it exists: Developed as a  project for Michigan EECS 280 (Programming and Intro Data Structures), this project integrates multiple course concepts into one larger system.
