# EECS 280 Euchre Project

This project is a C++ implementation of the card game Euchre.

‚ùì What it does: Allows two teams of players (human or computer) to play a full game of Euchre.

üë©‚Äçüíª Who it‚Äôs for: Students learning C++ fundamentals such as object-oriented design, polymorphism, operator overloading, and unit testing.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why it exists: Developed as a  project for Michigan EECS 280 (Programming and Intro Data Structures), this project integrates multiple course concepts into one larger system.

## FAQ

Q: Do I need to know the rules of Euchre to use this project?
A: Not necessarily since the game enforces rules automatically. However, some familiarity helps!

Q: Can I write my own AI player?
A: Yes, just inherit from the Player abstract class and implement the required methods.

Q: Does it work outside of EECS 280?
A: Absolutely. It‚Äôs standard C++11 and portable across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
